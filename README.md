# Data-Story-Telling-Responsible-Analytics-Practices
This week I learned how to process datasets (Data Understanding) into data visualizations then create Data Story Telling and learn Responsible Analytics Practices.

## Data Understanding (Dataset)
Data Understanding (Dataset) is a dataset that refers to the process of understanding and exploring the dataset used. This stage is the first step in analyzing data to understand the characteristics, properties, and content of the dataset before conducting further analysis. The goal is to gain initial insight into the dataset that will be used in the analysis.

In learning to analyze and process datasets, I use the Social Assistance Distribution Monitoring Dataset in the DKI Jakarta Region.The dataset contains data on the distribution of social assistance in DKI Jakarta during April 2020 to the poor and vulnerable people affected by Covid-19, both DKI KTP and Non DKI KTP.

The contents of the dataset column contain:
- Wilayah Kota : Name of the city where social assistance is distributed
- Kecamatan : Name of the sub-district where social assistance is distributed
- Kelurahan : Name of the urban village where the social assistance is distributed
- RW : Area based on RW that received social assistance
- Penerima (KK) : Number of recipients of social assistance count per (KK) 
- Jadwal Distribusi : Scheduling the distribution of social assistance in each region
- Tanggal Distribusi : Implementation of social assistance distribution in each region
- Sembako: Contains any basic necessities that will be distributed


## Data Story Telling
Data storytelling is the process of communicating insights, information, or findings found in data in a narrative way that is compelling and understandable to a wider audience. In data storytelling, data is transformed into a story that has a clear narrative flow, a clear communication objective, and can move the audience to understand, respond, or take action based on the information presented.

The following is story telling data using the Social Assistance Distribution Monitoring Dataset : 

- Total beneficiaries by 5 highest sub-districts (Pie Circle Chart)

  Story Telling :
  Based on the data, the district with the highest number of aid recipients is Kramat Jati District, about 22.7% of the total KK revenue in Kramat Jati, which shows that this area has significant aid needs during the period of PSBB related to COVID-19.

- Total social assistance recipients per City Region (Bar Chart)

Story Telling : Based on the data generated, you can see a comparison of the number of aid recipients (KK) in various areas of DKI Jakarta. So it can be seen that the city area of East Jakarta had the most aid recipients that year and the lowest aid recipient area was the Thousand Islands with a percentage of 1.51%. This percentage result is calculated based on the total data of aid recipients (KK) in the DKI Jakarta city area. In other words, the Thousand Islands region only has about 1.51% of the number of recipients (KK) in East Jakarta.

- Percentage of social assistance recipients categorized Kecamatan

Story Telling : Based on the data, it is known that there are 5 lowest sub-districts with the least number of recipients (KK), namely Gambir Subdistrict as much as 2.5% calculated from the total number of recipients (KK) based on the sub-district. This shows that Kecamatan Gambir has a relatively lower level of assistance (KK) than other kecamatan in the region

Story Telling : Based on the data, it can be seen that the lowest number of recipients based on RW is RW 23 with 0.43% of households and RW 24 and RW 25 have the same number of recipients, which is 0.68% of total recipients (KK).

- Total distribution of basic food items(Barplot Chart)

Story Telling : Based on the data above, it can be seen that the types of food are distributed equally. such as rice, biscuits, masks, soap, oil and canned sardines
