# Data-Story-Telling-Responsible-Analytics-Practices
This week I learned how to process datasets (Data Understanding) into data visualizations then create Data Story Telling and learn Responsible Analytics Practices.

## Data Understanding (Dataset)
Data Understanding (Dataset) is a dataset that refers to the process of understanding and exploring the dataset used. This stage is the first step in analyzing data to understand the characteristics, properties, and content of the dataset before conducting further analysis. The goal is to gain initial insight into the dataset that will be used in the analysis.

In learning to analyze and process datasets, I use the Social Assistance Distribution Monitoring Dataset in the DKI Jakarta Region.The dataset contains data on the distribution of social assistance in DKI Jakarta during April 2020 to the poor and vulnerable people affected by Covid-19, both DKI KTP and Non DKI KTP.

The contents of the dataset column contain:
- Wilayah Kota : Name of the city where social assistance is distributed
- Kecamatan : Name of the sub-district where social assistance is distributed
- Kelurahan : Name of the urban village where the social assistance is distributed
- RW : Area based on RW that received social assistance
- Penerima (KK) : Number of recipients of social assistance count per (KK) 
- Jadwal Distribusi : Scheduling the distribution of social assistance in each region
- Tanggal Distribusi : Implementation of social assistance distribution in each region
- Sembako: Contains any basic necessities that will be distributed
